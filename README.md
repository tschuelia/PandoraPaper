# Pandora Paper
This repository contains the code required to reproduce all datasets we used in the publication of our [Pandora tool](https://github.com/tschuelia/Pandora.git).

To run the code, you need the Pandora installed on your system. See the [Pandora documentation](https://pandorageno.readthedocs.io/) for installation instructions.
We highly recommend the installation using conda.
You further need to install jupyter. If you installed Pandora using conda you can simply run 
```
conda install jupyter
```


## Running the benchmark pipeline
In this repo we further provide the Snakemake pipeline we used to generate all Pandora results in the paper. 

TODO: instructions on how to install snakemake and setup the pipeline

TODO: add a link to the results/logs of the pipeline runs for all analyses
