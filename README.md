# Pandora Paper
This repository contains the code required to reproduce all datasets we used in the publication of our novel [Pandora tool](https://github.com/tschuelia/Pandora.git) for estimating the uncertainty of dimensionality reduction on population genetics data.


## Setting up the environment
To run the code, you need a few packages installed. You can use the provided `environment.yaml` file and conda:
```
conda env create --file environment.yaml
```

Note: if you are working on a MacBook with an M1 or M2 chip, installing EIGENSOFT from conda won't work.
In this case, remove the `- eigensoft` line from the environment file before executing the `conda` command above. 
Install EIGENSOFT by following the instructions in the [Pandora documentation](https://pandorageno.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-eigensoft-on-macbooks-with-m1-m2-chips).


## Reproducing datasets
Since the empirical datasets are based on genotype files in EIGENSTRAT format, we implemented a Snakemake pipeline for benchmarking
making use of the Pandora command line interface.

The simulated datasets we used in our paper are `RData` exports which we have to load as Pandora `NumpyDatasets`, thus using Pandora as Python library.

### Empirical datasets
1. Start the jupyter server by running `jupyter notebook` in your terminal. This should automatically start a new tab in your browser.
2. Open the jupyter file for the dataset you want to recreate. Note that for the Mathieson and Ã‡ayÃ¶nÃ¼ datasets, you first need to run the `NearEastPublic.ipynb` dataset as this provides the required modern samples for Mathieson and Ã‡ayÃ¶nÃ¼.
3. Execute the jupyter notebook.
4. Done ðŸ™‚

You can now use the dataset to run the benchmark pipeline:

1. First, you need to configure the snakemake pipeline according to the dataset you want to analyze. You can do so by modifying the `config.yaml` file. See the provided `config.yaml` for hints on the allowed settings.
2. Run the pipeline in dry-run mode to see what rules will be run and what files created: `snakemake -n`
3. Finally, run the pipeline using `snakemake -c1`. Note that using `c1` ensures that all rules are executed sequentially. This is required to make sure that all benchmarks are correct and don't influence each other.
4. You can load the resulting `results.parquet` file using pandas:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_parquet("results.parquet")
   ```

### Simulated Datasets
To reproduce the simulated dataset benchmarks, you first need to download the data as instructed in the first few lines of the `benchmark_simulated_data.py` script.
You can then adapt the `# CONFIG` section and set the analysis to `PCA` or `MDS` and run the benchmarks:
```bash
python bebenchmark_simulated_data.py
```    
    
Finally, you can load the resulting `results.parquet` file using pandas:
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet("results.parquet")
```


## Download the results
Instead of rerunning the analyses yourself, you can also download all (log)files from our experiments via [our lab server](https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/material/Pandora_supplementary_data.tar.gz).
The directory follows this structure:
